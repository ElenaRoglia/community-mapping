### Overview

Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, is the most seismically at risk city in the world in terms of potential for loss of human life during a major event. In November 2012,
in partnership with the government of Nepal, the World Bank and GFDRR launched a project to build seismic resilience in the Kathmandu Valleyâ€™s education and health
infrastructure, in part by creating a disaster risk model to determine the relative vulnerability of the relevant buildings. Once complete, the model will be used to prioritize
plans for retrofits of schools and health facilities to improve structural integrity in the face of earthquake.
