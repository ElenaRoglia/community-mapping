## Appendix 4 Sample Project Report

It is a good idea to provide snapshot progress reports every two to four weeks during a mapping project.
These can be brief, 1- to 2-page documents that highlight any news or changes in project design,
mapping progress, and metrics on data collection and quality control. The sample below suggests content
to include.

### Open Cities Project Update - July 1, 2014
I. Project Updates
A brief paragraph summarizing new project developments. For example, any unexpected changes in
the project, either positive or negative, may be recorded here. In other words, any project news, such as
meetings with key partners, mapping activities, and adjustments to the project design.
<p><div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>bullet points</li>
        <li>are good</li>
        <li>for document progress</li>
        <li>simply</li>
    </ul>
</div></p>

II. Mapping Progress
A simple map produced in GIS software can give a quick visual explanation of your progress.

## Appendix 6 Open Cities Project Planning Checklist

Here is a complete checklist you may wish to follow when planning a mapping project. It will help you to consider the
many factors that go into developing an efficient, effective process.

<div class="c-box">
  <p><b>Partner Outreach</p></b>

        <li>Write out your data model</li>
        <li>Map the data model to OpenStreetMap tags</li>
